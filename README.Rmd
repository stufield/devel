# The `devel` set of functions


## Overview

This "package" is the development package. Do not attempt to load it as you
would a typical package. It contains a loose testing ground of functionality
that, if deemed sufficiently useful, will eventually be migrated into an
appropriate package.


----------------

## Installation

You cannot currently install the `devel` library from the command line, as it
is not a package *per se*. The simplest way to obtain the functionality it
contains is to load it using the `RStudio` `devtools::load_all()` shortcut.

```{r load}
options(width = 110L)

devtools::load_all() # all objects, even non-exported, are accessible

ls("package:devel")
```
